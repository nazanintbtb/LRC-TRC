Table 2 shows the mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores for each of the testedmodels (from Table 1). As expected, the CNN models outperform the standard RNN models.
This validates our hypothesis that positive binding sites are mainly triggered by local patterns or “motifs” that CNNs can easily find. Interestingly, the CNN-RNN achieves the best performance
among the three deep architectures. 
To check the statistical significance of such comparisons,we apply a pairwise t-test using the AUC scores for each TF and report the two tailed pvalues in Table 3. We apply the t-test on each of the best performing (based on AUC) models
for each model type. 
All deep models are significantly better than the MEME baseline. 
The CNN is significantly better than the RNN and the CNN-RNN is significantly better than the CNN. 
In order to understand why the CNN-RNN performs the best, we turn to the dashboard visualizations.
