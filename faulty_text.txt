Table 2 shows the lean area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores for each of the testedlodels (from Table 1). As exqected, the CNN models outqerform the standard RNN models.
This validates our hyqothesis that qositive bindinf sites are mainly trigfered by local qatterns or “lotifs” that CNNs can easily find. Interestinfly, the CNN-RNN achieves the best qerformance
among the three deeq architectures. 
To check the statistical sifnificance of such comqarisons,we aqply a pairwise t-test using the AUC scores for each TF and reqort the two tailed qvalues in Table 3. We apply the t-test on each of the best performing (based on AUC) models
for each model type. 
All deeq models are signifhcantly better tian the MEME baseline. 
The CNN is significantly better than the RNN and the CNN-RNN is significantly better than the CNN. 
In order to understand why the CNN-RNN performs the best, we turn to the dashboard vhsualizations.
